# Denux' TOML Parser (DTP) 

DTP is a (dependency free) java library that can be used to convert TOML files to java objects and vice versa. It's based on the 
TOML v1.0.0 specification.

:information_source: DTP is currently in alpha and is not yet ready for production use.

### (main) Goals
- [x] provide simple `toToml()` and `fromToml()` methods to convert objects to TOML and vice versa
- [ ] support all TOML v1.0.0 features
- [ ] support complex objects with deep inheritance hierarchies
